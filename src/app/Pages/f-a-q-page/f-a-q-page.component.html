                of business analysts that can communication with the clients and customers and clarify the details of
                the requirements, we firstly create a documentation of the plan. After the analysis part has been
                completed, the entire plan will then be preceded and discussed with the development team to fine tune it
                and decide the modules and working strategy.

                Once the design gets approved, we showcase progress over the milestone of the project on the demo

              <p>EMD4IT’s team extension service allows you to hire pre-vetted, world-class developers as part of your
                team.
                <br>
                We handle all aspects of finding, vetting, and choosing the right candidates that you don't have the
                time, focus, desire, or sometimes expertise to do.
                <br>
                Most of our competitors provide TRANSACTIONAL hiring services. You post a gig, they match you up with a
                developer and you take it from there. We aren't a transactional service.
                <br>
                Best of all, you don’t need to spend hours sifting through online profiles, sorting candidates by hourly
                rates, and then picking the person you hope can do the job quickly, reliably, and for the right price.
                <br>
                We aren't just adding development capacity to your team. Our value is equally distributed across the
                entire project execution lifecycle. We take ownership and guarantee the delivery and quality of your
                project.
                <br>
                We use our proven processes, experience, and engagement models to make sure remote engagement delivers
                successful results.
                <br>
                This way you get the best of both worlds. You get transparency, access, and skill set you get from
                working with full-time developers. You also get the benefit of an experienced technology firm who is
                involved in successfully delivering your project.</p>

              <p>Finding developers and freelancers is easy — the hard part is knowing if you have found people who will
                truly deliver. This is specifically difficult if you don't have years of experience in vetting and
                choosing the best developers from a range of technologies. We do.
                <br>
                When we have candidates we like we give them a stage to showcase their communication skills and
                problem-solving ability through a series of video interviews. Here we are looking for people with highly
                relevant skill sets, well-documented code, and a disciplined approach to testing.
                <br>
                We develop comprehensive small project tests for every role. Each developer candidate's technical acumen
                is tested through an automated coding exam. Applicants are tested on language-specific knowledge as well
                as general programming and algorithm knowledge.
                <br>
                We do full reference checks with their previous clients and employers. We sign NDA and full proof legal
                contract to make sure your IP is protected. Speed is what Simform takes pride in — it typically takes
                only 24-72 hours for our clients to receive a short list of top candidates.</p>

              <p>Remote teams, whether comprised of developers from 50 miles away from you or 5,000 miles, bring pretty
                extraordinary advantages.
                <br>
                Knowledge sharing & documentation
                <br>
                The great thing about remote teams is that you are encouraged to keep communications in text format,
                which also means you will have a written record of all communication. In an office, so much is said
                casually in passing, and that knowledge is never captured.
                <br>
                You become more disciplined and process driven when working in a remote environment. This is great for
                any team but sometimes missed in in house teams.
                <br>
                Flexibility
                There is no greater sign of trust and respect you can give someone on your team than by offering
                flexibility with their schedule. They will harness that flexibility to give you incredibly focused hours
                of work that will be far more productive than office-hours would ever be.
                <br>
                Focus
                Offices are great for brainstorming and collaboration, but they cannot give you the focus you need for
                execution. Working remotely can. Development work requires intense focus and uninterrupted productive
                time.
                <br>
                Access to great talent around the world
                <br>
                With the world as your hiring pool, you can recruit far more developers and far more talented developers
                than the leftovers available in your local area. You will also end up with a far more diverse team of
                people with many different perspectives and approaches to solving challenges.
                <br>
                More opportunity to learn and grow
                Without a commute and more time available to them, remote developers are some of the most skilled and
                up-to-date developers in the world, thanks to the flexibility they have to keep learning and growing.
                <br>
                Timezones can be harnessed for greater productivity
                Most people assume that remote development is chaotic because of the differing time zones. This is
                actually the least of most remote teams’ worries. Time Zones are often utilized wisely so that there is
                enough overlap for each of the team members to sync up, but also enough difference in time to allow for
                continuous development to happen as one developer hands off work to another developer.</p>

                1) Test Cases Driven User Stories for Clear Requirements -
                When our engagement with the client starts we help them create detailed user stories and scope out the
                next few sprints.
                <br>
                2) Intense Sprint Planning
                In order to execute projects on time, you need to plan sprints as much as possible.
                <br>
                3) Iterative Delivery
                Typically, in an agile development process, we will divide the implementation process into several
                checkpoints rather than a single deadline. They are called iterations and are part of each sprint.
                <br>
                4) Documentation
                We document everything from application and code level architecture decisions, to live user stories
                document, to design focused UX/UI/Design System documents.
                <br>
                5) Constant Communication and Retrospective
                Stand-Up Each workday begins with a brief team stand-up meeting to discuss what we did yesterday, and
                what we plan to do today.
                <br>
                6) Code review
                A successful peer review strategy for code review requires a balance between strictly documented
                processes and a non-threatening, collaborative environment.
                <br>
                7) Integrating QA in the development process
                We have gotten much better about integrating QA in our development process. We used to loop QA in after
                our code was pushed to the master branch, which was clunky.

                Now our QA engineers will identify and create a test plan as soon as we begin working on the next
                sprint. As initial development nears completion, an engineer and a QA engineer will run through test
                scenarios together.
                <br>
                8) Post-release
                It’s important to circle back and review how the process went once you’re done, be it a success or
                failure.
                <br>
                Did the testing rightly model the production scenario? <br>
                Did your team correctly estimate the effort required to release a product? <br>
                How is the product running in production? <br>
                <br>
                Review how well the team performed by revisiting the implementation and testing checkpoints. Your team
                will adjust their performance accordingly as they grow used to being held accountable for every step in
                this process.
